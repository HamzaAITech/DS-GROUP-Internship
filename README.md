# DS-GROUP-Internship
As a Data Analyst intern at DS Group, I thrived in a dynamic work environment, gaining hands-on experience in HR Analytics Dashboard creation, EDA for sales data, and Time Series forecasting. Proficient in technologies such as Power BI, ARIMA, AR, and programming, I am adept at leveraging data to drive actionable insights and strategic decision-making.
